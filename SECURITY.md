# Advanced security for ReasonableFramework
Web hacking firewall(the advanced security against XSS, CSRF, and SQL-injection), DDoS protection, Webshell (malicious code) detection, secure configuration check. these extensions are only available for sponsors.

Even if you do not use a sponsor-only security module, the default security in our framework is usually sufficient.

Please note that this program is for those who want better security than the default.
